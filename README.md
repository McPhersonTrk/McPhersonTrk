 ## Introduction

For those struggling with math, here is something I learned in a philosophy class.

Math has nothing to do with numbers. 
Math is a language. 
More precisely, it is a language of logic.
It uses numbers as its alphabet.
It has rules and laws.
All of those rules your teachers spent years trying to instill in you—that is the grammar.

When you took English and Composition, you learned how to write a sentence and why you use certain marks, structures, etc., in that sentence. As you write a sentence, each word and punctuation you key in, and the order of the words, their definitions, and type all have meaning.

When combined, that meaning leads to the next piece. As you complete a sentence, you complete a thought. That thought either adds to the previous thought or concludes the line of thinking. Each sentence you write or speak, you are either adding to the equation or solving it.

Look at what I just did… do you see it?

- Why is there a comma after the word “sentence”?
- Period after the word “piece”?
- Why are the question marks inside the quotations?
- Were those quotations actually necessary?
- Did I use the correct homophone?
- Why is the first letter of each sentence capitalized?

Almost all of you can most likely not only read but check the laws of writing, as you do read and write. You do this with such fluidity that it is almost completely done without conscientious effort. You use the laws because you are completely inundated and immersed with them daily.

Unfortunately, we do not write or speak numerically. Therefore, it is a rarely used language. Its rules seem foreign and unwieldy. They, however, have logical reasons and can be shown to be true.

When we see a math problem, we have to solve a multitude of problems before we can even begin to work on the structure or figure out exactly what it is asking. This, in itself, can feel daunting. In other words, the hardest part of math is translating it into a language that your brain is accustomed to reading.

Here is a grammatical example:

The Order of Operations: P.lease E.xcuse M.y D.ear A.unt S.ally. AKA parentheses, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction

How in the world did they come up with that? Who decided Parentheses first? Without a thought, it appears asinine and arbitrary, right? It truly isn’t. Who decided the order of operations, anyhow? 

Was it some nerd, sick of all the bullies of their childhood? So, diabolical that (s)he decided the best revenge was making their children cry, and the bullies themselves left with thoughts of inadiquacy?

While quite entertaining and seemingly just crazy enough to be true. it is not. 

The true answer: NOBODY DID!  I know that it sure feels like someone HAD to invent it, it is just too evil to be a miraculous coincidence!!!

well, it definately wan't miraculous conception, either. So, who, or what invented it? well, to be honest, (for us english speakers) the  English language did it. Spoken language, not just english but in every language , chose that order. Whaaaaat? No way! Dead serious. The order of operations is done in that order because, when the equation is translated into spoken language, the sentence structure tells you what to do first.

Lost? Confused? Don’t worry, you are not alone. Most people cannot affectively literate mathematical equations as English. This is the root cause of most people's mathematical struggles. 

Disbelief? Do you feel the need to put your boots on, because "it" is getting deep? how about now?

Let’s work through an example.

Read this problem out loud:

8 + 20 ÷ 5 * 4 = _____

Honest assesment, go ahead an calculate the answer on paper. Got it? Stop peaking! Cheater Cheater, Pumpkin Eater!

So, now that you've done the maths! lets go over it.

Read it out loud again...

Now, that we know what it is asking for we should apply our grammar rule and compute. first we work through PEDMAS, and then go left to right, correct? 

how did you rear that problem? be honest. A lot of people will erroneously go to the division, then multiply, then calculate left to right.

If you read it that way: "eight + twenty ÷ five * four," right? You applied PEDMAS: and got, 8 + 5 * 4 = 8 + 20 = 28, right? 

if that was you, you translated that sentence wrong. 'You are the weakest link! Goodbye!' 

some other people would have completely forgot about PEDMAS and went left to right, those people came up with  28 ÷ 5 * 4 = 5.6 * 4 = 22.4. 

Nope, that isn’t right, either. I was also wrong, these people are the weakest link! Yowzer!

This math problem, when properly translated into English reads: 

## “The sum of 8 and 20 divided by the 5th multiple of 4.”

is that evcen English? yup, good old proper English.  I bet you are having more strange thoughts right about now: 'that makes no sense at all, there aren’t any parentheses!' Turns out they aren't needed. BS? or no BS?

No BS. It does not need parenthases because you misread what ÷ truly was saying. Huuuuh? Don't feel bad, it's a very common mistake. So, what went wrong?

you forgot one small itty bitty bit. Anytime you see: ÷, /, or ⟌, what are you dealing with? A fraction. 

keep cringing, I'll wait. I understand, fractions are evil and are always messing with people.

Rewrite it:

8 + 20 ÷ 5 * 4  =  8 + 20 ⟌ 5 * 4 

 Do you see it yet? it's okay if youi don't. On a PC screen, the long division symbol doesn't quite cover everything undernieth it.

How about...if you read it out loud: "8 + 20 OVER 5 * 4?"  

How about if, i were to express it as a fraction?

$$\frac{8 + 20}{5 * 4}$$ =  $$\frac{20}{28}$$ = $$\frac{7 * 4}{5 * 4}$$ = $$\frac{7}{5}$$ ==  1.4  =  1 remainder 2  = One & two-fifths 


there it is, the correct answer is:
$$\frac{7}{5}$$

let's take this problem one step further. As you read that multitude of numbers and fractions above, what exactly are they?

they lokk different but have the same value, same meaning. Is there a parallel to that in a spoken language?

Why yes, there is. You are reading a line of Synonyms, well mostly. In spoken language, a Synonym is defined as a word that has the same or nearly the same meaning as another word.

In math, a language of logic, there are no “nearly the same”—it is either True or False.

Let’s continue our exploration of PEDMAS and our language skills: compound words: here is one of my favorites:


## Antidisestablishmentarianism.


I absolutely love that word. I have only had the opportunity to use it verbally, maybe twice in my lifetime, which is why it is so wonderful.

It is long and convoluted, yet if you read the word correctly, you will see that the only operative part you need to know is “establishment” and everything else just falls into understanding.

Wait? What? Yeah, if you know the root and the definitions of its modifiers, you can easily define the word.

Anti- = against

dis- = against

establishment = the implementation and establishment of a national religion. 

-arian = someone who practices 

-ism = social practice, action, or norm

A side note and fun fact: being “Antidis-” something means you are “against being against” something. In other words, you are for or pro- it. 

Proestamlismentarianism = antidisestablishmentarianism. 

W00t, you just verbalized why a double negative, in math and English, creates a positive. Double word score! Hell yeah!

Excuse me while I put away my inner-nerd… and continue our pleasant math discussion. Well, F***. I know what you are thinking: “Oxymoronic, much?” Pssh, you just hush!

Moving right along, footloose and fancy-free… 

So, all together, Antidisestablishmentarianism is someone or some group of people who are against the removal of the social practice providing for a national, state-imposed, state-enforced religion. This means you are pro-theocracy.

Okay, that is all fine and dandy, but what does that have to do with arithmetic?

Quite simply, Anti... (you get it) is a compound word, an operative word, that is being modified by other parameters.

In the language of Math, the same thing is happening with parentheses and exponents.

## Mathmatically speaking, it is written Anti-[(-dis-)+{establishment}+(-arian)]-ism

Let's look at this expression: 1[1(1{x} + 0)1]^1/1 

(Note: a fractional exponent = a fraction. So, x^1/1 = x ÷ 1 and  x^1/2 = 1/(x^2^) = "1 over x squared" )

Okay, WTF is all of that about? The answer = x, where x can be any number you assign to it. Did you just roll your eyes at the pc screen? seriously? quit lying!

No matter what number you assign to the value of x, it will always return the same value of x.

How does that work, exactly? It’s because 1 is a null modifier. it's the mathmatical equivilant of a child arguing with their father about being denied candy, or told it is bedtime.  seriously, kid? has that shit EVER workd out for you? ever? yet, here we are. 

Now, here is the most crucial part, every number can be expressed as 1[1(1{x} + 0)1]^1/1. The parentheses represent the “root” word being modified ('establishment'.) 

Everything else is what is being done to that word, change the definition of the word/number as a whole.

If you don’t see the modifier written out or expressed, then that modifier's value is = 1. Furthermore, even if it isn't expressed in writeing, it is still there and has to be taken in account.

As this sections title suggests, if we wrote out our favorite compound word, mathmaically, it would look like this:

- Anti-[(-dis-)+{establishment}+(-arian)]-ism

If you replace, remove, or change any of those modifiers, you change the definition of the word.:

- 1-[(-1-)+{establishment}+(-arian)]-ism = someone who is for the implementation, and the social normatives, of a state religion. 

- Anti-[(-1-)+{establishment}+(-arian)]-ism = is someone who is against it, and against the social norms. 

- 1-[(-1-)+{establishment}+(-1)]-1  = the act of implementing a national religion. 

All of that is sounds pretty logical and you can see how the modifiers change the definition of the word. Right?

Now, let's apply that very same logic to value for (X).

1x = x = 1x1 = 1(x1)^1/1… ad infinitum... always = x.

So, exactly what does all of this mean? 

If you see parentheses, then everything touching those parentheses, expressed or in the case of 1, not expressed, are modifiers of the value within the parentheses.

Together, all of the modifiers, create the actual definition of the number you are speaking of. 

If you change, or ignore them, then the works meaning (value) will be changed. 

Do these modifiers have names? yup. In English, a modifer in front of a word is called a “prefix.” The modifier affixed to the rear is called a "suffix." 

For a numerical expression the number in front of the parenthesis is called a “coefficient.”  Okay, so now your probably thinking along the lines of, "oooh, so what it has a name. pbpbpbpbpbpt!"

I know, I get excited about some really odd things. Calculus is fun, there I said it, I enjoy a good derivation or integral more than I should. Bite me!

## Ah, a bear in its natural habitat: a Studebaker named "coefficient." 

Inconcievible! You keep saying that word. I don't think it means, what you think it means.

 NO MORE RHYMING AND I MEAN IT! 

Simply put coefficient expresses the multitude of the value inside the parentheses. 

1(x) means there is only one (x), where 999(x) means there are 999 of them all added together. Be glad it is there too, how'd you like to add a number together by hand, 999 times? Not so bad, when x=1, but imagine writing out: 1,421,667 + 1,421,667 + 1,421,667......996 more times? blah.

On the back side of the (), is the sufffix, an exponent. The exponent expresses the multiplicity, or how many times (x), is multiplied by and compounded upon itself.

## Summation... for now... it's late and you already think poorly of me. (AKA \TLDR)


In English, we have spelling, structures, punctuation, and grammar, which are a set of rules for the modification of letters to convey a specific idea. That idea being expressed is the solution to the letters themselves.

In Math, we have properties, laws, and functions, which are a set of rules for the modification of numbers to convey a specific and true idea or value.

In order to comprehend either, we must properly translate them into a usable language that we can understand.

If by some chance you approach a math problem, and it seems nonsensical to you, you don’t know what to do or how to proceed. The first step is to start by translating it into proper English.

Anyhow, I believe I have run my tank of nerdiness to E, and will sign off. Good day!
